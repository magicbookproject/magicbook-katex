# Magicbook Codesplit

This is a plugin that allows you to write example code in `.js` files, and include them in your book. It will parse your JavaScript files into sections with code and comments, so you can lay out your example in a nice, intuitive way.

## Using codesplit

Simply add this to your config file/

```json
{
  "addPlugins" : ["magicbook-codesplit"],
  "codesplit" : {
    "includes" : "examples"
  }
}
```

Then create this file in `examples/example.js`.

```js
// This is an example
var myName = "Rune Madsen";
```

Then in your content, use the `codesplit` tag.

```md
Now I want to show you an example.

{% codesplit example.js $}
```

When building the book, codesplit will output the following basic structure for you.

```html
<p>Now I want to show you an example</p>

<div class="codesplit">
  <div class="codesplit-content">
    <div class="codesplit-comment">
      <p>This is an example</p>
    </div>
    <div class="codesplit-code">
      <pre><code>var myName = "Rune Madsen";</code></pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

You have to write your own CSS to style these DIV's. The markup allows you to show the layout in a horizontal and vertical way.
